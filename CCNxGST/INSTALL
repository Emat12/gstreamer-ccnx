Downloading
===========
This project can be cloned with git to your local machine. It is not important where you create the
copy on your machine.

Linux - Build
=============
The typical auto-build steps should be followed:
  ./configure --with-ccn-dir=<prefix to where ccnx was installed>
  make install

The plug-in file will be located in: <prefix-path>/lib/gstreamer-0.10/libccnx.so
The build requires the libccn.a and headers from ccnx, thus you need to specify their location during
the configure step.

MSVC - Configuration
=============
Before building this plug-in, you must first create and set 3 new environment variables.
1- stop running any MSVC you may have
2- open the Control Panel->System
3- Under the tab "Advanced", select "Environment Variables"
4- Under "System Variables", click 'New'  [do this for each variable]
GST_DIR  - enter the path to your GStreamer installation
 e.g. C:\GC\gstreamer\0.10.4
OPENCV_DIR - enter the path to your OpenCV installation
 e.g. C:\Program Files\OpenCV
MSYS_DIR - enter the path to your MSYS installation
 e.g. C:\GC\msys
5- Now click 'OK' and 'OK' to commit these additions

You may now start your MSVC environment.

MSVC - Load The Solution, and build
=================
Within MSVC, File->Open->Project/Solution.
Navigate to where you cloned the gstreamer-ccnx project, and select the .sln file.
You are now ready to build the project.

The resulting CCNxPlugin.dll file will be under the Release folder. This should be
copied to a folder searched by the GStreamer tools [gst-launcher] prior to using the elements in a pipeline.
