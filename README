CCNxGST:
This MSVC Solution contains a GStreamer Plug-in used to transport media traffic over a CCNx network.
Within the solution is a single project, CCNxPlug that contains the 2 elements needed for the plug-in:
- ccnxsrc, which reads packets from the network and feeds them to the GStreamer pipeline
- ccnxsink, which sits at the end of the pipeline to publish packets onto the network
